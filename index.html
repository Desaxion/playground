                    <p>Hey there! I'm so glad you found my web page.<br><br> 
                        My name is Johan Björnfoot (formerly Arlinger since I got married recently), and I am 25 years old and live at the moment in Linköping, Sweden. This here is my website that I mainly use for posting my projects that I make in my spare time, but it also serves as sort of a resume for me. Please, look around and let me know if you found something you did or didn't like. 
                        
                        <br><br><br>
                        This website was made in pure HTML, CSS and JS, some of the icons under the contact tab was acquired from fontawesome.

The purpose of the game was for us to learn more about computer graphics, and to learn more about game programming. The game was created in C++ and OpenGL, with libraries like GLFW and ASSIMP. The space ship model was made by me in the software BlockBench. </p><div class="project-images"><img src="images/Asteroid.png" alt="star dwarves asteroid"><img src="images/Lava.png" alt="star dwarves lava"></div></div>

                        <div class="project-entry-content"><p class="about-project">During my first year of my master's programme I wrote my own Ray tracer in C++ for the course <span class="italic">TNCG15: Advanced Global Ilummination and Rendering</span>. The Ray tracer runs on the CPU and uses Monte-Carlo ray tracing together with Möller-Trumbore surface intersection computation techniques. The world which it renders is implicitly described, with mathematical descriptions for every surface. It also has support for either diffuse surfaces, mirror surfaces or light emissive surfaces.The final image is saved in a .ppm file. Libraries used for this project was OpenGL Mathematics, to help with vector calculations.</p><div class="project-images"><img src="images/2400x2400.png" alt="Ray Tracing"></div></div>

                        <div class="project-entry-content"><p class="about-project">Despite its misleading name, this project was a VR-based horror game project, created in Unreal Engine 5. The game is rather short, but was a way for me and my partners to explore how VR-games can be created, and how to incorporate immersive sounds in the game, as a lot of gameplay queues in the game are given through sound. Examples of this can be hearing where mice are in the walls to place mouse traps in the correct position, or finding which resident in the building is making too much noise. Eventually as the game progresses, it turns out the building the player is working in has a dark secret; a monster also lives in the building.</p><div class="project-images"><img src="images/finallevel.png" alt="landlord level"><img src="images/Corridor.png" alt="landlord corridor"></div></div>
